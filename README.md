# AV-Syncinator

AV-Syncinator is a small utility to measure
[Audio-Video-Synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio-to-video_synchronization).
It works by analyzing a recording of the playback of a specifically prepared
video file. It was created to be used in the context of remote desktop systems
(such as RDP, VNC, etc.), although other applications are conceivable.

More documentation will follow.
